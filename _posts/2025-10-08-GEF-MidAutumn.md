This a beautiful evening at Kaufman Hall, I had the privilege of participating in an event that celebrated the Mid-Autumn Festival, hosted by the Chinese Language and Culture Department at the University of Oklahoma. This event wasn’t just a cultural showcase, I see it as an immersive experience that allowed students like me to connect with Chinese traditions, learn from guest speakers, and engage in fun activities with the new people I meet.

## Creating a Productive Routine

The Mid-Autumn Festival, often regarded as one of the most important traditional holidays in Chinese culture, celebrates the harvest and the full moon. The event began with a cool presentation by a guest speaker who shared the history and significance of the festival. I was very amazed to learn about this celebration, which dates back over 3,000 years, therefore it was more than just about moon-watching, my favorite eating moon cakes. I have learn that it symbolizes reunion, peace, and prosperity, with a deep connection to family or the community. Hearing about the different myths associated with the full moon, such as the story of Chang’e, the Moon Goddess, all those lesson I still remember today.

As the time went by at the event, the event became even more interactive. We played several games that are traditionally played during the festival, such as riddles written on lanterns and fun. It was a nice way to bring people together, and it certainly helped build a sense of belonging to everyone that's there. One of the most memorable parts for me was the opportunity to see and meet new people. I had the chance to make new friends who shared an interest in Chinese culture, and we spent time discussing the stories, and foods associated with the festival.

Now the highlight of the evening was the showcase by the elderly members of the local Chinese community, who showcase their moon cake baking. I was so surprised by the process and how it’s passed down through generations. I tried other moon cakses, but the one that stood out to me the most was the red bean-filled moon cake. Its sweet and savory flavor is also fresh and warm. The impression and it quickly became my favorite.

As the night come near, we went to near hall outside to see if we can see the full moon. The timing was perfect, as the moon was a complete circle, shining brightly right above Lin Hall. The sight of the glowing moon was truly unforgettable. It felt as though everything had come together. I’ve since found myself reflecting on the themes of reunion and harmony that the Mid-Autumn Festival give me.

> Happy Mid-Autumn Festival!
